# This file is intentionally left blank.
# The agent is configured to run in a pure mock mode without external dependencies
# to ensure maximum compatibility.

# This file lists the Python packages that are required for the AI agent
# to run in LIVE mode (i.e., calling a real LLM).
#
# To install, run:
# pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#
# If the agent is run without these dependencies, it will automatically
# fall back to MOCK mode.

# The official OpenAI library. Version 0.28 is recommended for broader
# compatibility with Python 3.7+.
